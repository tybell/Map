    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
    <p>
      Over the last few decades, our news cycles seem to be saturated with terrorist attacks every few months. Terrorism and terrorist attacks are very emotionally and politically charged subjects, especially since the 9/11 terror attacks in the US. We want to create an interactive narrative visualization that more objectively presents this data. Our goal for this narrative visualization is to educate the average civilian about trends in terrorism and hopefully leave them better equipped to absorb and analyze modern terror events instead of naively believing the information presented by the mainstream media. We seek to answer whether terrorism is really more frequent and deadly today, or if the media has created a disproportionate frenzy around the subject in recent years.

Our intention is to blend interactive narrative with an exploratory analysis tool. We will first guide users through interesting/important aspects of the dataset, present overarching themes/questions, and then provide them with a section where they can explore the data themselves to answer questions they developed themselves. We decided on this blend because after exploring past projects, we found that narratives were more immediately engaging, since users are not forced to play around with a tool in order to gain meaningful information. Narratives portray already discovered insights at the beginning to pique viewersâ€™ interest; once users have been drawn into the topic, they will be more motivated to do their own exploratory analysis.

    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>
      Our dataset has data on terror attacks from 1970-2015 around the world, with info about location, type of attack (mass attack or assassination), who was targeted, the group responsible (or if the attack was even claimed), weapons used, ransom notes or manifestos (if applicable), etc.
